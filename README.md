# CSE 455 Final Project - Machine Learning Models for Syringe Identification
## Lauren He and Noah Krohngold

The main goals for this project were:
1. Optimizing existing YOLO models used by the University of Washington to identify syringes in frames
2. Automating image annotation for further training
3. Detecting text labels on syringes and extracting the text for verification of medicines used
